# Tetris
Classic Tetris game with multiple features: rotate shapes to right and to left, drop down the piece, score and top height.
There are 7 shapes: Z shape, S shape, line shape, T shape, Square Shape, L shape and mirrored L shape and 8 colors.
Each piece will have a random shape , it spawns in the same spot and can be moved with left and right arrow.
Down key (down arrow) will rotate the piece to the left and Up key(up arrow) will rotate the piece to the right.
By pressing spacebar, the piece will drop down.
When you complete a line(there are no spots left in it), it will dissapear and your score increases with 1.
If the block of pieces will reach top, the game is over.
Have fun!
